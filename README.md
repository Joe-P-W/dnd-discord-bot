## How to use
### Rolling
- To roll a d6 simply type into the discord chat "/r d6" 
- To roll multiple of the same dice "/r 2d8"
- To roll different dice "/r 1d8 + 2d12"
- To roll with an added bonus "/r 1d20 + 7"
- To roll with a multiplicative bonus "/r 2d6*2"

### Searching the SRD
At the moment the bot can search for spells found in the SRD. The bot does basic fuzzy matching 
so you can slightly misspell a spell, and the bot will find the closest matching spell.

- To search for a spell "/s fireball"

### Flipping coins
- To flip a coin "/flip"
- To flip multiple coins "/flip 6"

### Using D&D Bot as a calculator
- You can use the bot as a basic calculator "/c (7 + 5)*6"
